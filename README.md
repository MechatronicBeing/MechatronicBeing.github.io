## Features
- Understand, study, design, manufacture, maintain, work and live with **Mechatronic Beings**
- State-of-art animal/human-like virtual bots, industrial machines, drones and robots
- "All-in-One for All" approach
  - No specific field of research : vision and speech recognition, natural language, learning and planning, expert systems...
  - No specific programming language or material needed, the "mind" software :
    - can work on any computer, *albeit some benefits and drawbacks*
    - can work with any programming language, *albeit some benefits and drawbacks*
    - can use internal/external resources given : CPU, GPU, Memories, software, networks...
    - will try to use the resources intelligently (time, quality and quantity of resources are evaluated, to improve or reduce behaviors)
  - Less "hard" programming and less mathematics : the intelligence will self-develop (as genetic and generic)
  - Less artificial and less complex to build ; more concrete, complete, versatile and natural
- Access to Documentation, Programs, Resources, and more...
- Accessible for all, free of charge and without restrictions, **forever !**

## Warnings
- **Work in progress** (made by ONE person, very much to do)
- Like in real life, a Mechatronic Being :
  - requires a LOT of time, patience and activities like learning, evaluation, training, working...
  - depends a LOT on the "body" materials and the "mind" software used
  - depends a LOT on external stimuli : educational, social, professional, medical/technical, cultural...
  - can be a real "success", a real "failure", or "something unexpected", for an intended task (professional, industrial or autonomous)
