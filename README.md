## Features
- Understand, study, design, manufacture, maintain, work and live with **Mechatronic Beings**
- State-of-art human-like bots, machines and robots
- "All-in-One for All" approach
  - No specific field of research (vision, natural language, speech recognition, learning, planning, expert systems...)
  - No specific programming language or material needed, the mind software :
    - can work on any computer, albeit some benefits and drawbacks
    - can work (or be *reworked*) with any programming language, albeit some benefits and drawbacks
    - can exploit all the resources given : CPU, GPU, RAM, Hard Drive, others computers, others software...
    - try to learn to use the resources intelligently (execution time, quality and quantity of resources are evaluated)
  - Less "hard" programming and mathematics for the intelligence : do self-develop (as genetic and generic)
  - Less artificial and complex to build, more concrete, complete, versatile and natural
- Access to Documentation, Programs, Resources, and more...
- Accessible for all, free of charge and without restrictions, **forever !**

## Warnings
- **Work in progress** (made by ONE person, very much to do).
- Like in real life, a Mechatronic Being :
  - requires a LOT of time and patience, in activities like learning, evaluation, training, working...
  - depends on the "body" materials and "mind" software used
  - depends a LOT on external stimuli : educational, social, professional, medical/technical...
  - can be a real "success", a real "failure", or "something unexpected", for an intended task (professional, industrial or autonomous)
