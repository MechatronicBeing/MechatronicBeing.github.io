## What is a "Mechatronic Being" ?
- **Mechatronics** = Mechanics + Electronics/Electricity + Computer Software + Control systems
- **Being** = autonomous, unique and definied, animated
- Forms : 
  - physical : robot and industrial machines
  - virtual : computer programs (or "bots")
  - animal/human-like body/mind
- State-of-art technology and research
- Many fields of research : "natural" intelligence, natural language, vision and speech recognitions, learning and planning, expert systems...
- Many fields of activity : medical, industrial, educational, social, etc.

## Features
- Understand, study, design, manufacture, maintain, work and live with **Mechatronic Beings**
- **"All-in-One for All"** approach
  - No specific programming language or material needed, the "mind" software can :
    - work on any computer (*with some benefits and drawbacks*)
    - work with any programming language (with some benefits and drawbacks*)
    - use internal/external resources (CPU, GPU, Memories, programs, media, networks...), private/public, from start or added later
    - try to use the resources intelligently
  - Less "hard-coded" program and less mathematics : the intelligence will self-develop (with genetic and generic behaviors)
  - Less artificial ; simple building ; more concrete, complete, versatile and natural
- Access to Documentation, Programs, Resources, and more...
- Accessible for all, free of charge and without restrictions, **forever !**

## Warnings
- **Work in progress** (made by one person, very much to do)
- Like in real life, a Mechatronic Being :
  - requires a LOT of time, patience and activities like learning, evaluation, training, working, etc.
  - depends a LOT on the materials and software used (the "body" and "mind")
  - depends a LOT on external stimuli : educational, professional, medical/technical, contacts, cultural...
  - can be a real "success", a real "failure" or "something unexpected", for an intended task (professional, industrial or autonomous)
