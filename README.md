## Features
- Understand, study, design, manufacture, maintain, work and live with Mechatronic Beings.
- State-of-art human-like bots, machines and robots. 
- "All-in-One for All" approach : less complex to build, more complete and versatile.
  - New types of approaches : less artificial, more concrete, natural and lifely.
  - Less "hard" programming and mathematics for the intelligence : it will self-develop (as genetic and generic)
  - No "specific" programming language or material (like GPU) needed : it **can** work (or be **reworked**) on any computer with programming language -albeit some benefits and drawbacks- 
- Access to Documentation, Programs, Resources...
- Accessible for all, free of charge and without restrictions (and forever !).

## Warnings
- Work in progress (made by ONE person, very much to do).
- Like in real life, a Mechatronic Being :
  - requires a LOT of time and patience, in activities like learning, evaluation, training, working...
  - depends on the "body" materials and "mind" software used
  - depends a LOT on external stimuli : educational, social, professional, medical/technical...
  - can be a real "success", a real "failure", or "something unexpected", for an intended task (professional, industrial or autonomous being)
