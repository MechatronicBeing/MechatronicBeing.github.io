## Features
- Understand, study, design, manufacture, maintain, work and live with **Mechatronic Beings**
- State-of-art animal/human-like virtual bots, industrial machines, drones and robots
- "All-in-One for All" approach
  - No specific programming language or material needed, the "mind" software :
    - can work on any computer (*with some benefits and drawbacks*)
    - can work with any programming language (with some benefits and drawbacks*)
    - can use internal/external resources (CPU, GPU, Memories, programs, media, networks...), private/public, from start or added later
    - will try to use the resources intelligently
  - No specific field of research : vision and speech recognitions, natural language, learning and planning, expert systems...
  - Less "hard-coded" program and less mathematics : the intelligence will self-develop (with genetic and generic behaviors)
  - Less artificial and less complex to build ; more concrete, complete, versatile and natural
- Access to Documentation, Programs, Resources, and more...
- Accessible for all, free of charge and without restrictions, **forever !**

## Warnings
- **Work in progress** (made by ONE person, very much to do)
- Like in real life, a Mechatronic Being :
  - requires a LOT of time, patience and activities like learning, evaluation, training, working, etc.
  - depends a LOT on the materials and software used (the "body" and "mind")
  - depends a LOT on external stimuli : educational, professional, medical/technical, contacts, cultural...
  - can be a real "success", a real "failure" or "something unexpected", for an intended task (professional, industrial or autonomous)
