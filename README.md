## What is a "Mechatronic Being" ?
- **Mechatronics** = Mechanics + Electronics + Computer Software + Control systems
  - subdomain : robotics
  - examples : robots, industrial machines
- **Being** = alive, animated, high intellect, awareness, autonomous, individual, organism
  - examples : humans, animals, alive brains...
  - counterexamples : inert or "brainless" objects
    - materials (wooden, metal, water, gas...)
    - parts of an organism (limbs, torso...)
- Mechatronic Being : machine with a s
  - an artificial copy of beings
  - counterparts : Biological Beings (humans, animals...)

## Benefits
- Personals : cook, take care, shop, clean, wash, entertain, help, save time and money...
- Profesionnals : work, do repetitive or dangerous tasks, assist, help, watch, decide, train, create, save time and money... 
  - Activities : medical, industrial, educational, social, security...
- Researchers
  - computer science : intelligence, text/image/audio recognitions, language learning/processing, planning, expert systems...
  - neuroscience

## How to start ?
1. [read the documentation](https://mechatronicbeing.github.io/docs/)
2. [try the demos](https://github.com/MechatronicBeing/programs-demos/)
3. [build your own](https://github.com/MechatronicBeing/programs-main/)
4. [get the resources](https://mechatronicbeing.github.io/resources/)

## Features
- an **"All-in-One for All"** approach : one comprehensive project for all uses
- No specific programming language or material needed
  - work on any computer (*with some benefits and drawbacks*)
  - work on any programming language (*with some benefits and drawbacks*)
  - use internal/external resources (CPU, GPU, Memories, programs, media, networks...), private/public, from start or later
  - use the resources intelligently
- Less "hard-coded" program and less mathematics : the intelligence will self-develop (genetic and generic behaviors) 
- Less artificial ; simple building ; more concrete, complete, versatile and natural
- Access to Documentation, Programs, Resources, and more...
- Accessible for all, free of charge and without restrictions, **forever !**

## Warnings
- **Work in progress** 
  - made by one person
  - requires a lot of work : search for public resources, write and format texts, check the contents and licenses, organize files and folders, publish online... 
- requires a LOT of time, patience and activities like learning, evaluation, training, working, etc.
- depends a LOT on external stimuli : educational, professional, medical/technical, contacts, cultural, etc.
- depends a LOT on the materials and software used, and the teaching approach
- can be a big "success", a "failure" or "something unexpected", for an intended task (professional, industrial or autonomous)
